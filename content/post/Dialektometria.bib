	abstract = {In this paper we measure the degrees of association among aggregate pronunciational, lexical and syntactic differences in 70 Dutch dialect varieties. First, we show that pronunciation is marginally more strongly associated with syntax than it is with lexis and that syntax and lexis are only weakly associated. Then, we check for the influence of geography as an underlying factor because geography is known to strongly correlate with each of the linguistic levels under investigation. We find that pronunciation and syntax are more strongly associated with geography than lexis is. Finally, we refine the results by accounting for the influence of geography as an underlying factor and show that the association between pronunciation and syntax turns out to be largely based on geography. Some influence between pronunciation and syntax remains but the association between pronunciation and lexis is stronger. There is virtually no association between syntax and lexis.},

	abstract = {Although there are several good books on unsupervised machine learning, we felt that many of them are too theoretical. This book provides practical guide to cluster analysis, elegant visualization and interpretation. It contains 5 parts. Part I provides a quick introduction to R and presents required R packages, as well as, data formats and dissimilarity measures for cluster analysis and visualization. Part II covers partitioning clustering methods, which subdivide the data sets into a set of k groups, where k is the number of groups pre-specified by the analyst. Partitioning clustering approaches include: K-means, K-Medoids (PAM) and CLARA algorithms. In Part III, we consider hierarchical clustering method, which is an alternative approach to partitioning clustering. The result of hierarchical clustering is a tree-based representation of the objects called dendrogram. In this part, we describe how to compute, visualize, interpret and compare dendrograms. Part IV describes clustering validation and evaluation strategies, which consists of measuring the goodness of clustering results. Among the chapters covered here, there are: Assessing clustering tendency, Determining the optimal number of clusters, Cluster validation statistics, Choosing the best clustering algorithms and Computing p-value for hierarchical clustering. Part V presents advanced clustering methods, including: Hierarchical k-means clustering, Fuzzy clustering, Model-based clustering and Density-based clustering.},

	abstract = {Historical relationships among languages are used as a proxy for social history in many non-linguistic settings, including the fields of cultural and molecular anthropology. Linguists have traditionally assembled this information using the standard comparative method. While providing extremely nuanced linguistic information, this approach is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Conversely, computational approaches are appreciably quicker, but can potentially introduce significant error. Furthermore, current methods often use cognate sets that were themselves coded by historical linguists, thus reducing the benefit of computational approaches. Here we develop a method, based on the ALINE distance, to extract feature-sensitive relationships from paired glosses, datasets that require minimal contribution from trained linguists beyond transcription from primary sources. We validate our results by comparison with data generated independently via the comparative method, and quantify error rates using consistency indices. To showcase our method's utility and to demonstrate its robustness at local and regional scales, we apply it to two language datasets from eastern Indonesia. As linguistic datasets proliferate, scalable computational methods that mimic historical linguistic reconstruction will become increasingly necessary. Although at present we cannot disentangle all the processes driving linguistic change (e.g. lexical borrowing), our method provides a robust and accurate alternative to manual linguistic analysis. The feature-sensitive method adopted here accurately and automatically identifies emergent patterns hidden in traditional word-lists by analysing critical phonetic information that is discarded (or required as prerequisite) by many current cognate-based computational methods. This approach is not intended to supplant manual linguistic analysis, but has an important role in quickly generating robust data for non-linguistic fields or interdisciplinary projects that require formal quantitative analysis of historical linguistic relationships. Our approach provides a workable approximate phylogeny in cases where a trained linguist is unavailable, or otherwise significantly reduces the time and effort required for manual classification.},
